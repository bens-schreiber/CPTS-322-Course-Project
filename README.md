# WSU CPTS 322 Course Project -- PollPal

Created for Washington State Universities Software Engineering I course.

Inspired by iClicker and Kahoot, PollPal allows an individual to host a session joinable via a PIN code, post real-time questions at the pace of the host, and see analytics corresponding to the chosen solutions by anyone in the lobby.
